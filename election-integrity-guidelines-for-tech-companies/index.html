          <h1>Election Integrity Guidelines for Technology Companies</h1>
        
        <p><i>(version 1.0, last updated March 18, 2024)</i></p>

<h2 id="chapeau">Chapeau</h2>

<p>The goal of the below guidelines is to provide foundational practices that technology companies, including large and small players, should adopt. The goal of these guidelines is to provide a shared set of expectations for companies and election authorities as they each work to advance election integrity and provide high quality information to voters. The intent of these guidelines is also to improve communications channels between technology companies and election authorities, and to reduce barriers to supporting election integrity for smaller and newer companies.</p>

<p>These guidelines are broadly applicable to providers of products and services encompassing social media and entertainment platforms, search, mapping, online advertising, and cybersecurity and threat intelligence services, among others. Most companies operate in only some of these spaces; as a result not all guidelines will be relevant to all companies and individual companies should assess which are appropriate for them. These guidelines are not intended to address needs related to specialized election technology such as voting machines or to vendor relationships. They are also not intended to address concerns related to generative AI and other emerging technologies. Some companies have already made a variety of commitments in line with the principles in these guidelines. This document is not meant to contravene or otherwise weaken those commitments.</p>

<p>In many cases, reciprocal action is required by election authorities or civil society for the full benefit of these commitments to be realized. That said, election authorities take a variety of forms globally, ranging from fully independent entities to compromised entities conducting elections with predetermined outcomes in authoritarian states.  Companies should therefore not engage or engage fully with all election authorities; companies should tailor their approach in consultation with local and international experts, as necessary, for each context and potentially for each election.</p>

<p>These guidelines are appropriate for immediate implementation and are expected to be refined and expanded 12-18 months from publication based on lessons learned. Companies are encouraged to communicate publicly regarding their intentions to engage with and use these guidelines, whether globally or for specific countries and elections.</p>
