          <h1>Tech impacts every election.</h1>
        
        <p>In a historic year for global elections, the <a href="ifes.org">International Foundation for Electoral Systems</a>, in consultation with prominent election authorities, civil society organizations, and technology companies, is proud to launch the Voluntary Election Integrity Guidelines for Technology Companies. With more than 70 countries holding national-level elections this year, these guidelines provide a shared set of expectations and practices for companies and election authorities as they work to advance election integrity in a deteriorating information environment. The guidelines were released at the Summit for Democracy hosted by the Republic of Korea in Seoul.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>The management of elections has been complicated by disinformation about voters’ rights and the voting process, improper political advertising, online attacks (on officials, candidates, poll workers and the integrity of the process), calls for violence, cyberattacks on elections infrastructure and trustworthy information outlets, internet throttling, disruptions and shutdowns on election day. While independent election authorities attempt to hold bad actors accountable, they are increasingly under attack.</p>

<p>The lack of alignment and communication between election authorities and technology companies has stifled coordination to make technology work in support of electoral processes. These guidelines will help establish a guide for meaningful engagement and support between election authorities and technology companies. They will establish clear policies and processes to share information around elections, and ensure voters have access to high-quality information. They will also improve communications channels between technology companies and election authorities, while reducing barriers to supporting election integrity for smaller and newer companies who aim to be responsible actors around elections.</p>

<h2 id="our-response">Our response</h2>
<p>The launch of these guidelines is the first step in a sustained effort to make incremental and practical gains that meaningfully support election integrity. The launch is an invitation to technology companies - whether big or small, well established or up-and-coming, and whether they provide social media platforms, cybersecurity services, telecommunications, advertising, search or AI, to engage. It’s likewise an invitation to civil society organizations and election authorities globally to help shape the use and improvement of the guidelines.</p>

<p>As enshrined in the guidelines themselves, the coming year will serve as proving and consultation period, after which the guidelines will be refined and expanded.  In a quickly changing electoral and technological world, it’s important that we continue to learn and adapt as quickly as possible.</p>
