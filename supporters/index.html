Our team at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab) has worked with a combination of election authorities, online platforms, and civil society groups in over countries across five continents since 2018. One thing has been apparent throughout — common standards for digital platforms facilitating democratic processes are needed.
